<p>Torres started photographing when she was ten, but started to pursue the art seriously when she was thirteen. When she was fourteen she started taking classes at the International Center of Photography and then when she was sixteen started taking their advanced and intensive program, Imagemakers. She continued photography throughout high school and even helped on two photoshoots for Tory Burch Sports, the athletic line for Tory Burch.</p>

In addition to photography, she has pursued Grahpic Design, creating multiple posters for various on campus groups as well as the Student Government Social Committee, which she chairs.</p>

<p> Outside of school, Torres has interned at the Brooklyn Museum, helping in the Development Department and mainly focusing on creating visual identities for events at the museum that compliment the artist or artwork being showcased.
